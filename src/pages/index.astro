				<Card title="What is this?" body="This is a future voxel based, roguelike/soulslike open world game. It will be community driven, meaning that the community will be able to contribute to the game." />
				<Card title="Why is this?" body="This game started off as a project for our entrepreneurship class at NTI Gymnasiet, Karlstad. But due to lack of time making a tech demo, we decided to focus on making it a community based game." />
				<Card title="How will this work?" body="The idea is quite simple really, the game will be free to compile/build, ad free and open source. The game will be community driven, meaning that the community will be able to contribute to the game. We have a discord server where we will discuss the status and what the game will come out to be, amongst ourselves and aswell as the community which will be a way of contributing to the game, but there's a catch, as we publish the game to steam and other platforms, to get a free license, you will have to have contributed to the game in one way or another. Although simply changing the readme of the repo or changing 1-2 lines that bring barely any change won't be enough. Validity of getting a license granted will be personally reviewed by the staff of Goop Studios." />
				<Card title="When did this start?" body="The company was founded in 2023 as a part of an event in our entrepreneurship class with the task of developing a game for our own company." />
				<Card title="How do I contribute?" body="You can contribute to the page by going to the contribute page or by visiting our github, both buttons are above. You can also contribute to the game by joining our discord server and discussing the game with us." />
